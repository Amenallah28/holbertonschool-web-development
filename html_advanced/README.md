# HTML, Advanced

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a webpage from scratch based on a designer file provided in Figma. The focus is on building the HTML structure without any CSS styling. The tasks are divided into several sections to progressively build the webpage.

## Concepts Covered

- HTML elements and their purposes
- Semantic sectioning elements
- HTML validation
- Creating an HTML page from a wireframe
- Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM)
- Using attributes and tags in HTML

## Resources

- [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
- [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)


## Project Structure

All files should end with a new line. A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory. External libraries are not allowed; the website must be built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ensure your code is W3C compliant and validate it using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Repository

- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-web-development`


## Validation

Ensure your HTML code is W3C compliant. Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your code.

## Notes

- The project does not require any CSS styling at this stage.
- Some values in the designer file might be in float; feel free to round them.
- Make sure to create an account on Figma to access the final design and "Duplicate to your Drafts" for all design details.
